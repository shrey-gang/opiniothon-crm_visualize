Targeted Problem Statements:
 A next generation customer relationship management tool
 A data visualization toolbox to visualize large data


Idea – 

Part 1 – Creating a promotion controller, which will interact with all the food/ecommerce suppliers, and get all the offers that they are providing and will send the few selected and most suitable offers to users/people in mail/messages based on a smart optimized logic. 

The shortlisting of offers to be sent to user will take in the below mentioned parameters in consideration – 
User’s past browsing history
User’s past order history
Previously used offers
Location 

The algorithm will make sure of sending only relative and interesting offers to user and improving the order conversion rate, as it will be centralized platform for promotion for all the suppliers.

Part 2 – Creating a visualization platform for the suppliers to show the statistics related to their products/offers/conversionRate. Which will be useful for them to provide more relevant offers in future in order to improve their selling.
